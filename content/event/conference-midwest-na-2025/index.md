summary: 'Seamless multiphysics coupling with peridynamics enabled by nodal finite element approximation'
abstract: 'This presentation discusses ongoing research in the seamless coupling of physics, such as diffusion of chemical components (corrosion) and temperature, with the peridynamics theory of fracture. This is achieved by a recently proposed and published nodal finite element approximation (NFEM) of peridynamics (Jha, Diehl, Lipton (2025) CMAME). NFEM provides a finite element representation of the deformation of structures at a computational cost comparable to mesh-free methods. Corrosion and heat distribution based on partial differential equations usually employ finite element approximation. Thus, the coupling is easily introduced by combining NFEM for peridynamics and FEM for other physics. After discussing formulation and numerical methods, some preliminary results will be presented, including cracking of two-dimensional structures in corrosive fields and under in-homogeneous temperature distribution.'
