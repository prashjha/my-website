summary: 'Multiphysics Peridynamics Coupling and Neural Operators for Design and Inference'
abstract: 'At the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM18) in Chicago, the CEAD Lab presented two complementary research efforts. The first introduces a nodal finite element approximation (NFEM) for peridynamics, enabling seamless coupling of fracture mechanics with other physics—such as corrosion and heat diffusion—via standard finite element methods. The second explores neural operators for accelerating parameter estimation and topology optimization, focusing on strategies to control approximation errors in data-limited scenarios. Applications include parameter inference in diffusion and elasticity problems and topology optimization of magnetic soft materials.'

<!-- Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
