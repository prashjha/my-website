summary: 'Application of peridynamics to granular media'
abstract: 'This talk will present recent work on the application of peridynamics to granular media. While discrete element methods (DEM) effectively describe interactions in particulate systems, they lack the ability to model intra-particle fracture. To address this limitation, a novel framework combining the strengths of nonlocal fracture theory and DEM, referred to as PeriDEM, has been developed. This hybrid approach enables the modeling of both inter-particle interactions and intra-particle fracture dynamics. Model parameters can be tuned to achieve specific damping effects and inter-particle contact strengths. Numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach will be presented. However, the high computational cost of combining peridynamics and DEM remains a challenge. To mitigate this, the second half of the talk will explore recent work on alleviating computational bottlenecks using a hybrid discrete-continuum approach.'
