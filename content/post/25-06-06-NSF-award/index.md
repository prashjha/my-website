A huge thank you to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the ERI award ([link](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2502279))! The awarded amount is $200k over two years. 

This project will focus on developing an **Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Framework for Modeling Heterogeneous Materials Under Extreme Conditions.** We will be pushing the boundaries of how we simulate granular media like sand and rocks under intense stress. The attached video shows a glimpse of our work with the PeriDEM model!

> We are actively seeking enthusiastic undergraduate and graduate students interested in computational mechanics and applying advanced numerical and machine learning-based methods to problems in fracture mechanics, functional soft materials, and granular materials.
