Thrilled to share some exciting news! Our lab at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been awarded two new grants to pursue cutting-edge research in computational materials science. The first one is from NSF; see [NSF award news]( {{< relref "post/25-06-06-NSF-award" >}}).

The second award is a South Dakota Board of Regents Competitive Research Grant (CRG), which includes $90k over one and half year. 

The title of this project is **Modeling and Design of Magnetic Soft Materials Accelerated by Neural Operators.** We will focus on developing capabilities for sustainable research on topic of modeling, analysis, and design of functional materials, specifically focusing on magnetic soft materials. The objectives of this project include comparing different models of effective material properties in magnetic soft materials, develop topology optimization solvers, and leverage neural operators to accelerate the computation. 

> We are actively seeking enthusiastic undergraduate and graduate students interested in computational mechanics and applying advanced numerical and machine learning-based methods to problems in fracture mechanics, functional soft materials, and granular materials.
