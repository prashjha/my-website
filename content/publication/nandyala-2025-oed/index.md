abstract: "Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia is an emerging cancer therapy that utilizes magnetic nanoparticles subjected to alternating magnetic fields to generate localized heating and selectively target tumor tissues. Despite its potential, clinical implementation faces significant challenges due to uncertainties in the thermophysical properties, nanoparticle distribution, and magnetic particle parameters, which can compromise the precision and efficacy of the treatment. This article introduces an information-theoretic framework for optimal experimental design in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia to address these challenges. By accounting for uncertainties in key parameters, such as tissue thermal conductivity, blood perfusion rate, and nanoparticle anisotropy constant, the framework maximizes mutual information between the observed data and model parameters, enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. A surrogate 1D model is employed to reduce computational complexity, allowing the identification of optimal magnetic field amplitudes across diverse initial conditions and scenarios, including single and multiple uncertain parameters. The results highlight the robustness of the optimization approach, demonstrating consistent convergence to a stable solution that is expected to enable precise temperature measurement and effective parameter recovery. This study underscores the potential for mutual information-based optimization to advance the planning of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia treatment and provides a foundation for future experimental and clinical applications."
