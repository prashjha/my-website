abstract: "	We consider electrostatic interactions in two classes of nanostructures: (1) helical nanotubes, and (2) thin films with uniform bending (i.e., constant mean curvature). Starting from the atomic scale with a discrete distribution of dipoles, we obtain the continuum limit of the electrostatic energy; the continuum energy depends on the geometric parameters that define the nanostructure, such as the pitch and twist of the helical nanotubes and the curvature of the thin film. We find that the limiting energy is local in nature. This can be rationalized by noticing that the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run over one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit."
